# Shitty Mod (quite litterally)


Just a shitty mod for minecraft that i develop to learn a new language ... 
Yeah java is evil and actually wants you dead but hey .... guess i'm kinda into that ... 


## Random stuff to note
Mod version : 0.0.1 Not even close to be a real mod

For minecraft 1.14.4


## How to Use it 

Download and install forge for minecraft 1.14.4, then place the modfile in the "Mods" folder located in your minecraft folder.

This mods is prett much the incarnation of uselessness... but if you really want it, i ain't gonna stop you

To craft the shitty block, you're gonna need some clay and dirt, place it like this in a crafting table :

clay dirt

dirt clay


and ... done ! You have now two magnificent shitty blocks ! Your mom must be proud of you !


## Modpack use

If you think your modpack isn't shitty enough, you're free to use it, just quote me .. or abraham lincoln ... i don't care
