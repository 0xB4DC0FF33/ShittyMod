# Shitty Mod (quite literally)


Just a shitty mod for minecraft that i develop to learn a new language ... 
Yeah java is evil and actually wants you dead but hey .... guess i'm kinda into that ... 


## Random stuff to note
Mod version : 0.0.1 Not even close to be a real mod

For minecraft 1.14.4


## How to Use it 

Firstly, download and install forge for minecraft 1.14.4

Download the mod in the "Relase" section of this github (that don't even exist right now... so find a way, you can do it, grow up, be a man) then place the modfile in the "Mods" folder located in your minecraft folder.

This mods is prett much the incarnation of uselessness... but if you really want it, i ain't gonna stop you

To craft the shitty block, you're gonna need some clay and dirt, place it like this in a crafting table :

clay dirt

dirt clay


and ... done ! You have now two magnificent shitty blocks ! Your mom must be proud of you !


## Modpack use

If you think your modpack isn't shitty enough, you're free to use it, just quote me .. or abraham lincoln ... i don't care
